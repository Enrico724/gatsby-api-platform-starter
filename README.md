<h1 align="center">
  Gatsby + API Platform
</h1>


## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the hello-world starter
    gatsby new my-app https://github.com/Enrico724/gatsby-api-platform-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Before starting, open the `/api-platform/public/api/index.php`, and rewrite the autoloder into `require_once dirname(__DIR__).'/../vendor/autoload_runtime.php';`

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-app/
    npm run develop
    ```

    **NOTICE:** insted of running `gatsby <command>`, use the available script defined in `package.json`. All Gatsby commands are rewritten in order to fully function with tha API-Platfom framework.

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Gatsby is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    
    Symfony is now running at `http://localhost:4000`!

    The source code is under the src Directory

## 🧐 What's inside?

## 🛠 Build

This starter has been built in order to port your app in any enviroment using less devops possible. Once you have run `npm run build`, your app will be available inside build directory. public will be places as your public_html folder, and my-app folder will we placed in the root folder.

The only manual operation you have to do is opening the '/build/public/api/index.php' and edit the require file in order to it links you app souce code. This has to be done in order to make api-platform working.
